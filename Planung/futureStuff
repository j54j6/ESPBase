Description Part -> Updateserver

IMPORTANT: 
my program has an integrated updater you can update my libary automatically via webinterface (manually or completly automatic) - 
my servers uses a monitoring program to check all needed update parameters (e.g chiptype (at this time only esp8266 can use this sketch (tested with esp8266) 
and the used version of sketch/free space on our ESP - 
i dont save any information except default server log content (ip adresses)), 
there are no personal information recorded! - 
your sketch will be removed until i find a way to extract your hookup program into another file and add it after update... 
e.g with a little buildserver in this case you can compile your update and send it to your esp via uiupdate.nodework.de 
but i will find out ^^
